<p>The problems in this section are designed to integrate multiple concepts from the course. &nbsp;They are typically going to be more challenging and require more thought and planning than the section-specific problems. &nbsp;The time targets are provided as a reference only, and part of that time should be spent on designing your program rather than writing it. &nbsp;Enjoy!</p>
